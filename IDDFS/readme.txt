In this assignment we have implemented IDDFS (Iterative Deepening Depth First search) algorithm. 
The code is written in C++

The compiler version (g++ --version) : Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)

Commands to run the program 
g++ -std=c++11 iddfs.cpp
./a.out

Input: The program takes as input 16 distinct numbers in range 0-15 entered one after another.
Output: The program will give the desired out if the configuration is solvable or will print that it's not solvable.
